Neuronvisio connect with NEURON using the new python\r\nNEURON interface.\r\n\r\n![Pyramidal Neuron Voltage change](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mattions/neuronvisio/master/docs/_static/pyramidal_3D_change_voltage.png)\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n--------\r\n\r\n-   3D visualization of the model with the possibility to change it\r\n    runtime\r\n-   Creation of vectors to record any variables present in the section\r\n-   Pylab integration to plot directly the result of the simulation\r\n-   Exploration of the timecourse of any variable among time using a\r\n    color coded scale\r\n-   the GUI runs in its own thread so itâ€™s possible to use the console\r\n    (integrated with IPython)\r\n-   automatically download and load models from [ModelDB](http://senselab.med.yale.edu/modeldb/)\r\n\r\nDocumumentation avaialble at http://docs.neuronvisio.org\r\n","google":"UA-26394685-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
